# Blogapp
This is a simple blogapp that i have made on nodeJS using features like express and another ones. I hope you enjoy this website and share your commenters with me on my linkedin or another social media. Good Bye! 

# Course
This website was made during my NodeJs course on youtube, if you wanna try learn this too, search from "Victor Lima - Curso completo de Node JS".

It's a brazilian course but it's really good, if you have problems you can use the youtube's commentes to help you to improve your code
